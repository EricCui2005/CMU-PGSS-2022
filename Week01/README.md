# 6/28/2022 Notes

Today we learned about the basics of Colaboratory on Google Drive and how to import and analyze different sets of data into the software. We also learned the basics of R Studio and the general capabilities of the programming environment

Colaboratory
- The programming interface is actually extremely intuitive once you learn the ropes. Adding code and text blocks is extremely easy and convenient, and the environment is extremely easy to use. Learning how to import data sets was also extremeley quick and easy. The searchable coe snippets proved very useful. 

R Studio
- I am going to be completely honest, I have no idea what I'm doing with this program.
